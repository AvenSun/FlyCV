FlyCV is a high-performance library for processing computer visual tasks. We have made a lot of optimization on the ARM sideï¼Œmaking it faster than other image processing libraries. At the same time, we are also starting optimizing on other CPU platforms and heterogeneous computing platforms. Not only fasterï¼Œcompared to other image processing libraries, it provides us with more fine-grained compilation options and is lighter in size.

Through the demo below, you can feel the speed and effect comparison between FlyCV and OpenCV.

## :notebook: Documents

### API Documents
To make it easier for everyone, our interface design is close to OpenCV. Howerver, there are some differences between the two.
<br>
Just see the interface documentation for more details: 

[ðŸ“– API Documents](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/FlyCV/wiki/API-Documents)

### Compile from source
We support most major operating systems, including android, arm linux, macos(x86 & arm), windows, ios. 
You can compile from source by following the documents below.
